    affiliation: Team Rudra
    startDate: 2023-08-01
    endDate: 2024-01-15
    highlights:
      - Enhanced the functionality of a rover by programming Blackpill microcontrollers to act as daughter boards, effectively managing subsystems like arm, bio-arm, astronaut’s box, etc to reduce overall system failure.
      - Implemented `CAN` interface communication with pixhawk and later directly through 433 MHz
      - Embraced the board‑agnostic approach inherent to Zephyr, allowing for easy customization through device tree configuration. This approach ensures that code compiles effortlessly for any Zephyr‑supported hardware board, aligning with the Linux philosophy of portability and adaptability.
